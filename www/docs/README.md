A Proven approach to helping every development organization become an integration agile organization. The Reference Architecture for Agility is a technology nutral logical architecture based on a disaggregated cloud-based model. It can be applied in incremental stages to create an integration agile foundation for any digital enterprises - deployable in private, public or hybrid cloud environments.

## Emerging Reference Architectural Patterns

+ ### [Cell-based Reference Architecture](reference-architecture-cell-based.md)
  Functional capabilities grouped in an architecture unit based on scope and ownership. It is a decentralized where data moves within and across cells and governance is transparently applied through a control plane embedded within cells.
+ ### Segmented Reference Architecture
  Functional capabilities sub-grouped within layers based on organizational ownership. It is a centralized system where data flow moves from layer to layer.
+ ### Layered Reference Architecture
  Functional capabilities grouped in layers by following a System of Systems view. It is a centralized system where data moves from layer to layer.
